## Background

eGaming is one of the popular entertainments nowadays. Twitch is a live streaming site popular with gamers that lets you share live game play for others to watch and comment on in real time. You can also watch playbacks of games being played and chat to other gamers. As a result, it created groups of communities which are eager on eGaming, and always discuss and comment on the eGames, and other hot topics. Therefore, the aim of this project is to analyse the eGaming discussion in Twitch. The analysis can be the hot topics discussion, favorite eGamers, eGaming scenes, etc. The project outcomes are expected to help the sports managers to know more about the fansâ€™ favorite eGames, eGaming stars, eGaming scenes, etc., for future eGaming super stars recruitment, eGaming design, and eGames marketing.
